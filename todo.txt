# Generic:
- Arrow key navigation
- Add more text/improve the story flow?

# Worldmap:
- labels with index for country on hover
- Legend for the worldmap (bottom right showing scale bands for each of the 5 colors?)
- Title on top left showing: <FEATURE> - <YEAR/Growth>
- Better hover effect (shader instead of white color?
- Better selected effect (shader/border/whatever?) and remove red color
- DONE fix center worldmap

# Slide 1:
- Add explanation for each of the 6 features and their respective colors

# Slide 2:
- Growth chart is not the same as text (it's not at 100% at 2090, @Emily, where did you get the 2090 value?)
- The growth chart is pretty ugly as it is now,
    either:
    - replace with timeline?
    or
    - add markers for 100% horizontal line
    - add vertical line or something at 2020 to show that that's the current year?
    - add vertical line when GEI reaches 100%?
    - add hover effect/label that shows date, (expected) index, and feature name
    - change to dashed line after 2015 so it's clear what is predicted for the predicted values.
- If we keep this chart, add hover effect showing expected index in certain year, and feature name
- Add a legend?
- If we keep growth chart: fix the rerendering of axis and scale stuff, just as it is done in IndexBarChart and LoadingBarChart

# Slide 3 4 5:
- Add hover effect to IndexBarChart, showing at least the index and country name, if you don't know of a clean way to get
the country name from the current data, add a temporary string, and I'll fix that tomorrow/wednesday
- Decide whether or not to show all countries on those charts but just top N? Because otherwise slide 4 and 5 are more
or less the same?
- Decide whether or not you can also select a feature on these slides to show the values just for that feature? Is
already more or less implemented, we just need to decide whether we want to add that here already.
- Decide what we want to do with showing the EU score in these slides

# Slide 6:
- Current chart looks out of place and does not add a lot compared to slide 7, especially if the domains are explained
in slide 1. So probably remove entire slide, we can discuss this tomorrow afternoon.

# Slide 7:
- IMPORTANT: fix updating of the values when data changes (when the country prop changes)
- Remove drop down for features, since you can click on the chart
- Add hover/selected effects to LoadingBarChart
- Restyle it so it is more clearer that 100% is the max? Maybe wrap boxes around the charts? restyle the axis? I don't
know, go wild hehe
- Add a title to the chart that shows exactly for what year and country it is currently showing, regarding getting the
full country name, see the point above, just add a temp string if you can't get it.
